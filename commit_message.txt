Fix Chronos database schema and datetime handling

This commit addresses two critical issues in the Chronos data caching component:

1. Database Schema Fix:
   - Added missing 'interval' column to the candles table in market_data.db
   - Updated the primary key to include (symbol, start, interval)
   - This allows different time intervals (OneMinute, OneDay, etc.) for the
     same symbol and timestamp to coexist in the database

2. Datetime Handling Fix:
   - Resolved timezone comparison issues in the get_candles method
   - Added proper handling for timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetime objects
   - Improved error handling for datetime parsing

Additional changes:
- Added example fix scripts in examples/bugfixes directory with documentation
- Updated README.md with information about the fixes
- Added .gitignore to exclude database files
- Added data/.gitkeep to ensure the data directory is tracked in git

These fixes ensure all Chronos methods work correctly for different time intervals
and prevent datetime-related errors when retrieving historical candle data.
