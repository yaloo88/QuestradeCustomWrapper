train_data with frequency 'None' has been resampled to frequency 'min'.
Provided train_data has 734426 rows (NaN fraction=67.1%), 7 time series. Median time series length is 105200 (min=104115, max=105526). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'close'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        ['interval']
		continuous (float): ['low', 'high', 'open', 'volume', 'VWAP']

AutoGluon will ignore following non-numeric/non-informative columns:
	ignored covariates:      ['end']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MAPE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
