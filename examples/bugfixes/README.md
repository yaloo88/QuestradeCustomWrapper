# Chronos Implementation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing 'interval' Column in the Database Schema

**Problem:**
The `candles` table in the `market_data.db` database was missing the `interval` column, which is referenced in several methods in the Chronos class.

**Fix:**
Created a script `fix_candles_table.py` to:
1. Create a backup of the existing candles table
2. Recreate the candles table with the correct schema, including the `interval` column
3. Updated the primary key to include the `symbol`, `start`, and `interval` columns
4. Restored data from the backup table with a default 'OneMinute' interval value

**Verification:**
Created `verify_db_fix.py` to test the fix by:
1. Checking the table schema to confirm the `interval` column exists
2. Verifying the primary key includes all three columns
3. Testing insertion of candle data with the same timestamp but different intervals
4. Confirming data retrieval with interval filtering works correctly

### 2. Datetime Handling Error in get_candles Method

**Problem:**
The `get_candles` method had an error when comparing timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetime objects:
```
Error in get_candles: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
```

**Fix:**
Created a script `fix_datetime_handling.py` to:
1. Update the datetime handling code in the `get_candles` method
2. Added proper timezone handling to ensure both datetime objects have compatible timezone info before comparison
3. Added error handling to prevent crashes due to datetime parsing issues

## Summary of Changes

1. **Database Schema Changes:**
   - Added the `interval` column to the `candles` table
   - Updated the primary key to include (`symbol`, `start`, `interval`)
   - Set a default value of 'OneMinute' for the interval column

2. **Code Changes:**
   - Fixed the datetime handling in the `get_candles` method
   - Ensured proper timezone-awareness when comparing datetime objects
   - Added error handling for datetime parsing

## How to Test

The fixes were tested using:
1. `verify_db_fix.py` to verify the database schema changes
2. `test_chronos_examples.py` to verify the overall functionality of the Chronos class

Both fixes have been successfully implemented and all tests are now passing.
